# Semantic-Search

**Semantic-Search** is a Python toolkit for fast, intelligent search using **vector embeddings**.  
It converts text into embeddings with **Sentence Transformers** and performs **efficient semantic search** via **FAISS**, supporting multiple database backends. This allows meaningful search across both structured and unstructured data.

## üß† About

Semantic search goes beyond keyword matching by understanding the **meaning of text**. This toolkit:

- Transforms text into vector embeddings using pre-trained models  
- Performs fast similarity search using **FAISS**  
- Supports multiple backends: MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL  
- Returns the most relevant results based on semantic meaning rather than simple keyword matches  

It‚Äôs ideal for applications like **document retrieval, Q&A systems, recommendation engines**, or any system where understanding context is critical.
